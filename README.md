## Description

You are going to make it big by playing the stock market – “buy low, sell high” you scream as you sit down at your computer. You’ve heard good things about this company Computershare - so you start investigating its historic share prices. You’re going to need to time your trades so that you make the biggest gain possible! But there’s a catch, as you’re new to the game, your broker will only allow you one trade.

So, you look back at a list of market-opening prices for Computershare stock. You are not into this risky day-trading approach, so are looking at the opening price each day of the last month.

You decide to put a program together (using industry best-practice standards of course!) using your favorite language, to help you work out what the single best trade you could have made that month would be, to maximize gain.

Remember - buy low, sell high. And before you ask… unfortunately your DeLorean won’t start, so you can't sell before you buy.

## Input Description

Your program will be provided with a list of Computershare’s market-opening stock prices from the beginning of each trading day of the last month. It will be formatted as a comma separated list of two decimal floats (pounds and pence), listed in chronological order from day 1 through to day 30 of the month. Sample datasets are included in this Zip file.

Example:

`19.15,18.30,18.88,17.93,15.95,19.03,19.00 etc..`

## Output Description

Your program should provide the buy day and sell day – so two days of the month and their opening stock prices. So, in chronological order showing when you should buy, and sell, again separated by a comma.

To confirm - the format being buyDayOfMonth(price),sellDayOfMonth(price)

Example:

`5(15.95),6(19.03)`
